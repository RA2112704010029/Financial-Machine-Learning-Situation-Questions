# Financial-Machine-Learning-Situation-Questions
The following are some situation based questions in Financial Machine Learning and their respective Python codes

1. SITUATION - 1:
Assume you are working on a recommendation system where you need to suggest movies to users based on their past ratings. You decide to use the KNN algorithm for this task.

• Discuss the importance of the value of 'k' in the KNN algorithm and its impact on the model’s performance.

• Write a Python code snippet using sklearn to implement a KNN-based recommendation system, including theselection of the optimal 'k' value.

• Describe the steps involved in cross-validation and how you would evaluate the performance of the recommendation system.


2. SITUATION - 2:
In a scenario where you are predicting loan defaults, how would you handle missing values and imbalanced classes in the dataset? Explain the steps in detail and provide the relevant Python code for feature selection and classification.

   
3. SITUATION - 3:
Explain how you would use k-means clustering to categorize a set of stocks into similar groups based on their returns and volatility. Describe the process of identifying the optimal number of clusters using both the elbow method and silhouette score and include relevant Python code.

   
4. SITUATION - 4:
A trading strategy requires clustering a set of financial stocks into homogeneous groups based on historical price and volatility. Explain how you would use the k-means clustering algorithm for this purpose and demonstrate how you would determine the optimal number of clusters. Include relevant Python code snippets.
